**Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** is an **architectural approach** and **software design methodology** focused on **modeling complex business domains** through a deep understanding of the problem space and the relationships between different business concepts.

### **Key Concepts of Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
DDD is built around **aligning software design with the business domain** and encourages collaboration between domain experts and developers.

#### **1. Strategic Design (High-Level)**
- **Bounded Context**: Defines clear boundaries where a particular domain model applies. Each bounded context has its own models and language.
- **Ubiquitous Language**: A common language shared by domain experts and developers to avoid misunderstandings.
- **Context Mapping**: Defines how different bounded contexts interact and integrate.

#### **2. Tactical Design (Implementation Level)**
- **Entities**: Objects with a unique identity that persists over time (e.g., `Customer`, `Order`).
- **Value Objects**: Immutable objects that represent a concept but have no identity (e.g., `Money`, `Address`).
- **Aggregates**: A cluster of related domain objects treated as a single unit (e.g., `Order` and `OrderItems`).
- **Repositories**: Abstractions to retrieve and persist aggregates (e.g., `IOrderRepository`).
- **Domain Services**: Business logic that doesn't naturally fit within an entity or value object (e.g., pricing calculation).
- **Application Services**: Coordinate domain objects to fulfill use cases but donâ€™t contain business logic themselves.

### **How DDD Differs from Clean Architecture**
| Feature                | Domain-Driven Design (DDD) | Clean Architecture |
|------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|
| **Focus** | Business domain modeling | Architectural separation of concerns |
| **Core Concept** | Entities, aggregates, value objects | Layers, dependency inversion |
| **Application** | Best for complex, business-driven applications | Best for maintaining clear system boundaries |
| **Boundaries** | Defines bounded contexts and relationships | Defines layer boundaries for maintainability |

### **When to Use DDD**
- When working on **complex business domains** (e.g., banking, logistics, healthcare).
- When business rules change frequently and need a **flexible yet structured approach**.
- When a **deep collaboration with domain experts** is necessary.
