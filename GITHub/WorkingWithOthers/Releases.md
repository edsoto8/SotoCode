# GitHub Releases

Releases are a GitHub feature that help you package and provide software to users. They're based on Git tags and allow you to include release notes and binary assets for download.

## Creating Releases

### Manual Release Creation

1. **Navigate to Releases**:
   - Go to your repository
   - Click "Releases" in the right sidebar
   - Click "Create a new release" or "Draft a new release"

2. **Choose a Tag**:
   - Select an existing tag or create a new one
   - If creating a new tag, you can base it on a specific branch

3. **Fill in Release Details**:
   - Add a release title (often the version number)
   - Write detailed release notes
   - Optionally mark as pre-release or draft
   - Upload binary files as release assets

4. **Publish the Release**:
   - Click "Publish release"

### Using Git Tags on the Command Line

```bash
# Create and push a tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0

# Create an annotated tag with a message
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Version 1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

Then create the release on GitHub based on the pushed tag.

## Release Best Practices

1. **Use Semantic Versioning**:
   - Format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 1.2.3)
   - Increment MAJOR for incompatible API changes
   - Increment MINOR for backward-compatible new features
   - Increment PATCH for backward-compatible bug fixes

2. **Write Detailed Release Notes**:
   - List new features, changes, and bug fixes
   - Document any breaking changes
   - Include upgrade instructions if needed
   - Credit contributors

3. **Include Relevant Assets**:
   - Compiled binaries
   - Source code archives (automatically generated)
   - Documentation PDFs
   - Installation packages

## Automating Releases

### Using GitHub Actions

```yaml
name: Create Release

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      # Build your project and generate assets
      - name: Build
        run: |
          npm install
          npm run build
      
      - name: Create Release
        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
        with:
          files: |
            dist/app.exe
            dist/app.dmg
            dist/app.deb
          draft: false
          prerelease: false
          body_path: CHANGELOG.md
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Working with Pre-releases and Drafts

- **Draft Releases**: Create and edit before publishing
- **Pre-releases**: Mark as "pre-release" for beta/RC versions
- **Latest Release**: Only full releases are considered "latest"

## Releases and Tags Relationship

- Every release is based on a Git tag
- Not every Git tag needs to be a release
- Releases provide a user-friendly interface around Git tags

Releases provide a convenient way for users to download your software and see what changed in each version, making your project more accessible to users who aren't familiar with Git.
