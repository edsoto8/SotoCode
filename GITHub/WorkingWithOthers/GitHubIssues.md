# GitHub Issues

GitHub Issues is a powerful tracking system built into every GitHub repository that helps teams manage work, track bugs, and collaborate on projects.

## What Are GitHub Issues?

GitHub Issues serve as a centralized place to:
- Track bugs and defects
- Request new features
- Plan enhancements
- Document tasks and to-do items
- Manage project work
- Collect user feedback

## Creating and Managing Issues

### Creating an Issue

1. **Navigate to the repository** you want to create an issue for
2. **Click the "Issues" tab** near the top of the repository
3. **Click "New issue"**
4. **Fill out the issue form**:
   - Title: Clear, concise summary
   - Description: Detailed explanation with context
   - Labels: Categorize the issue
   - Assignees: Assign responsibility
   - Projects: Link to project boards
   - Milestone: Connect to release planning

### Issue Components

- **Title**: Summarizes the issue
- **Description**: Markdown-formatted details
- **Comments**: Ongoing discussion thread
- **Labels**: Color-coded categories
- **Assignees**: Responsible individuals
- **Milestones**: Group issues for releases/sprints
- **Linked pull requests**: Related code changes

## Organizing Issues

### Labels

Labels help categorize and filter issues:
- **Bug**: Something isn't working
- **Enhancement**: New feature or request
- **Documentation**: Documentation improvements
- **Good first issue**: Good for newcomers
- **Help wanted**: Extra attention needed

### Milestones

Milestones group issues for specific targets:
- Release versions
- Sprint planning
- Project phases

### Issue Templates

Create templates to standardize information:
1. Create `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory
2. Add template files (markdown or YAML format)
3. Templates appear when users create new issues

## Best Practices

- **Be specific** in issue descriptions
- **Include reproduction steps** for bugs
- **Use labels** consistently
- **Reference related issues** with #issue-number
- **Close issues** with keywords in pull requests
- **Search before creating** new issues

## Advanced Features

- **Task lists**: Create to-do items with `- [ ]` syntax
- **Issue linking**: Reference other issues with #number
- **Mentions**: Notify users with @username
- **Cross-repository references**: Link to issues in other repos
- **Automated projects**: Use project boards for kanban-style tracking

GitHub Issues forms the backbone of project management and collaboration on GitHub, providing structure to development workflows and team communication.
