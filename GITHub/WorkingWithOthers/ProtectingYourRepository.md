# Protecting Your Repository

Protecting your GitHub repository is essential for maintaining code quality, preventing unauthorized changes, and ensuring security. Here's how to implement various protection measures:

## Branch Protection Rules

1. **Navigate to Repository Settings**:
   - Go to your repository
   - Click on "Settings" tab
   - Select "Branches" from the left sidebar

2. **Set Up Branch Protection Rules**:
   - Click "Add rule" under "Branch protection rules"
   - Enter branch name pattern (e.g., `main`, `master`, or `release*`)
   - Configure desired protections

3. **Essential Protection Options**:
   - Require pull request reviews before merging
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Require signed commits
   - Include administrators in restrictions
   - Restrict who can push to matching branches

## Code Security Features

1. **Enable Dependency Alerts**:
   - Go to "Settings" > "Security & analysis"
   - Enable "Dependency graph"
   - Enable "Dependabot alerts"
   - Enable "Dependabot security updates"

2. **Secret Scanning**:
   - Enable "Secret scanning" to detect accidentally committed credentials
   - Set up notifications for detected secrets

3. **Code Scanning**:
   - Set up CodeQL analysis for automated vulnerability detection
   - Configure custom code scanning workflows

## Access Control

1. **Repository Visibility**:
   - Choose appropriate visibility: Public, Private, or Internal
   - Change in "Settings" > "General" > "Danger Zone"

2. **Manage Collaborators**:
   - Go to "Settings" > "Manage access"
   - Add collaborators with appropriate permissions
   - Set up teams with specific access levels

3. **Set Up Required Reviews**:
   - Require specific number of approvals
   - Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
   - Restrict who can dismiss pull request reviews

## Additional Security Measures

1. **Security Policy**:
   - Add a SECURITY.md file with vulnerability reporting guidelines
   - Define security expectations and processes

2. **Required Status Checks**:
   - Enforce CI/CD workflows pass before merging
   - Set up linting and testing requirements

3. **Signed Commits**:
   - Require GPG signed commits
   - Set up commit signature verification

4. **IP Allow Lists**:
   - For organization repositories, restrict access to specific IP ranges
   - Configure in organization settings

5. **Automate Security Updates**:
   - Configure Dependabot for automatic security patches
   - Set up scheduled dependency updates

By implementing these measures, you can significantly enhance your repository's security, maintain code quality, and prevent unauthorized or accidental changes to important branches.
