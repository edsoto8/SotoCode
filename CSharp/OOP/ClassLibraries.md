A **C# Class Library** is a collection of reusable code that's compiled into a **DLL (Dynamic Link Library)** file instead of an executable (`.exe`). You can think of it like a toolboxâ€”full of functions, classes, and utilitiesâ€”that can be used across multiple applications (like console apps, web apps, or other libraries).

### Key Points:

- ðŸ“¦ **No `Main()` method**: It's not meant to run on its own.
- ðŸ§° **Reusable code**: You define classes, interfaces, and methods that other apps can use.
- ðŸ”„ **Shared across projects**: You can reference it in multiple projects to avoid duplicating code.

### Example Use Case

Imagine you have a `MathUtilities` class with helper methods like this:

```csharp
namespace MyUtilities
{
    public class MathUtilities
    {
        public static int Add(int a, int b) => a + b;
        public static int Multiply(int a, int b) => a * b;
    }
}
```

You compile this in a class library project called `MyUtilities.dll`. Then, in your main application, you can reference that `.dll` and use:

```csharp
using MyUtilities;

int result = MathUtilities.Add(5, 3);
```

### When to Use One

- You're writing **utility functions** or shared business logic.
- You want to **organize code** into separate modules.
- You're building a **plugin or API** for others to use.

# Additional Notes on C# Class Libraries

## Creating and Managing Libraries
- **Project Creation**: Create using Visual Studio (File > New > Project > Class Library) or via CLI (`dotnet new classlib`)
- **Project References**: Add dependencies via NuGet or direct project references
- **Organization**: Consider organizing related classes into meaningful namespaces

## Assembly Management
- **Strong Naming**: Use strong-named assemblies to uniquely identify your libraries
```csharp
[assembly: AssemblyKeyFile("myKey.snk")]
```
- **Assembly Info**: Control metadata via assembly attributes
```csharp
[assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.0.0")]
[assembly: AssemblyCompany("Your Company")]
```

## Visibility Control
- **Internal Access**: Members marked `internal` are only visible within the same assembly
- **InternalsVisibleTo**: Allow specific assemblies to access internal members
```csharp
[assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("MyTests")]
```

## Distribution
- **NuGet Packaging**: Create `.nupkg` files to distribute via NuGet
```xml
<PackageId>MyCompany.MyLibrary</PackageId>
<Version>1.0.0</Version>
<Authors>Your Name</Authors>
```
- **Private Feeds**: Host private packages for team/organization use
- **Documentation**: Generate XML documentation for IntelliSense

## Cross-Platform and Framework Targeting
- **Multi-targeting**: Target multiple frameworks in one library
```xml
<TargetFrameworks>net6.0;net7.0;netstandard2.0</TargetFrameworks>
```
- **Conditional Compilation**: Use `#if` directives for platform-specific code
```csharp
#if NET6_0_OR_GREATER
// .NET 6+ specific code
#else
// Fallback implementation
#endif
```

## Testing Considerations
- **Unit Test Projects**: Create separate test projects that reference your library
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage of public APIs
