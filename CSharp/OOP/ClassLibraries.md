A **C# Class Library** is a collection of reusable code that's compiled into a **DLL (Dynamic Link Library)** file instead of an executable (`.exe`). You can think of it like a toolboxâ€”full of functions, classes, and utilitiesâ€”that can be used across multiple applications (like console apps, web apps, or other libraries).

### Key Points:

- ðŸ“¦ **No `Main()` method**: It's not meant to run on its own.
- ðŸ§° **Reusable code**: You define classes, interfaces, and methods that other apps can use.
- ðŸ”„ **Shared across projects**: You can reference it in multiple projects to avoid duplicating code.

### Example Use Case

Imagine you have a `MathUtilities` class with helper methods like this:

```csharp
namespace MyUtilities
{
    public class MathUtilities
    {
        public static int Add(int a, int b) => a + b;
        public static int Multiply(int a, int b) => a * b;
    }
}
```

You compile this in a class library project called `MyUtilities.dll`. Then, in your main application, you can reference that `.dll` and use:

```csharp
using MyUtilities;

int result = MathUtilities.Add(5, 3);
```

### When to Use One

- You're writing **utility functions** or shared business logic.
- You want to **organize code** into separate modules.
- You're building a **plugin or API** for others to use.
