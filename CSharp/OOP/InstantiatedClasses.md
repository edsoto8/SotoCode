An **instantiated class** in C# refers to the process of **creating an object** (or instance) of a class.

### Here's what it means, simply:

- A **class** is like a blueprint. It defines the structure and behavior (properties and methods) of something.
- An **instance** is a specific, usable object created from that blueprint.
- When you **instantiate** a class, you’re saying “create a real thing from this blueprint.”

### Example:

```csharp
public class Car
{
    public string Make;
    public string Model;

    public void Honk()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Beep beep!");
    }
}

// Instantiating the class
Car myCar = new Car();
myCar.Make = "Toyota";
myCar.Model = "Corolla";
myCar.Honk();  // Output: Beep beep!
```

In the above example:
- `Car` is the class (the blueprint).
- `myCar` is the instantiated object (a real car object based on the Car class).
- `new Car()` is the instantiation – it creates a new instance of the `Car` class.

### Summary:

- **Instantiating a class** = Creating an **object** from a **class**.
- Uses the `new` keyword in C#.
- After instantiation, you can use the object to access properties and methods defined in the class.
