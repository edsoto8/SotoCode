# Coding Standards for C#

1. Naming Conventions:
    - Use PascalCase for class names, method names, and properties.
    - Use camelCase for local variables and method parameters.
    - Use ALL_CAPS for constants.

2. Project and Solution Names:
    - Don't use spaces in project/solution names.
    - Use Pascal Casing for project names (e.g., `HelloWorld.proj`, `MyFirstProject.solu`).

3. File Organization:
    - Place each class in its own file.
    - Name the file after the class it contains.

4. Indentation and Spacing:
    - Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
    - Place curly braces on a new line.

5. Comments:
    - Use XML comments (`///`) for public members.
    - Use `//` for single-line comments and `/* */` for multi-line comments.

6. Error Handling:
    - Use exceptions for error handling.
    - Avoid using exceptions for control flow.

7. Code Layout:
    - Organize code into regions for better readability.
    - Group related methods together.

8. Best Practices:
    - Avoid magic numbers; use constants or enums instead.
    - Prefer `var` when the type is obvious from the right side of the assignment.
    - Use `async` and `await` for asynchronous programming.
