SOLID is an acronym that represents five key principles of object-oriented software design. These principles help developers create maintainable, scalable, and flexible code.

1. **S** - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**  
   *A class should have only one reason to change.*  
   - Each class should focus on a single functionality.
   - Helps in reducing complexity and improving readability.

2. **O** - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**  
   *Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.*  
   - You should be able to add new functionality without altering existing code.
   - Promotes the use of inheritance and interfaces.

3. **L** - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**  
   *Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.*  
   - Derived classes should not break the behavior of their parent class.
   - Helps in achieving robust polymorphism.

4. **I** - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**  
   *Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.*  
   - Large interfaces should be broken into smaller, more specific ones.
   - Prevents unnecessary dependencies and increases flexibility.

5. **D** - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**  
   *High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.*  
   - Reduces coupling by depending on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations.
   - Facilitates dependency injection and improves testability.

By following SOLID principles, developers can write code that is easier to understand, test, and extend over time.
