Planning a project based on requirements involves several key steps. 

---

### **1. Understanding the Requirements**  
- Gather all requirements from stakeholders.  
- Identify functional and non-functional requirements.  
- Clarify any ambiguities through discussions or documentation.  

---

### **2. Define Project Scope**  
- Clearly define what is included and what is out of scope.  
- Establish key deliverables and success criteria.  

---

### **3. Identify Key Components & Features**  
- Break down the project into high-level modules.  
- Identify dependencies between features.  
- Prioritize features based on importance and dependencies.  

---

### **4. Create a Task Breakdown (Work Breakdown Structure - WBS)**  
- Divide the project into phases (e.g., Planning, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance).  
- Break each phase into specific tasks and subtasks.  

---

### **5. Set Milestones and Deadlines**  
- Define major checkpoints to track progress.  
- Set realistic deadlines for each milestone.  

---

### **6. Assign Responsibilities**  
- Identify roles needed (e.g., Analyst, Designer, Developer, Tester, Project Manager).  
- Assign tasks based on expertise and availability.  

---

### **7. Identify Risks & Challenges**  
- List potential risks (e.g., requirement changes, resource constraints, technical challenges).  
- Define mitigation strategies for each risk.  

---

### **8. Plan Communication & Documentation**  
- Define how progress updates will be shared (meetings, reports, dashboards).  
- Maintain clear documentation (requirements, decisions, progress reports).  

---

### **9. Define Quality Assurance & Testing**  
- Establish criteria for testing (unit testing, integration testing, user acceptance testing).  
- Plan for feedback collection and iterations.  

---

### **10. Deployment & Maintenance Strategy**  
- Plan for deployment (staging, production, rollback plan).  
- Define support & maintenance strategy (bug fixes, updates, monitoring).
