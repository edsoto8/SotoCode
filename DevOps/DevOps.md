DevOps is a set of practices, tools, and cultural philosophies that aim to automate and integrate software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It emphasizes collaboration between development and operations teams to improve software quality, accelerate delivery, and enhance reliability.

### **Key Aspects of DevOps:**
1. **Collaboration & Communication** – Developers and IT operations work together closely.
2. **Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** – Automating code integration, testing, and deployment.
3. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** – Managing infrastructure using code rather than manual processes.
4. **Monitoring & Logging** – Continuous tracking of application performance and errors.
5. **Automation** – Reducing manual intervention in testing, deployment, and infrastructure management.
6. **Security (DevSecOps)** – Integrating security practices into DevOps workflows.

### **Benefits of DevOps:**
- Faster software releases
- Improved software quality and stability
- Increased collaboration and efficiency
- Reduced downtime and faster recovery

### **Popular DevOps Tools:**
- **CI/CD:** Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI
- **Containerization:** Docker, Kubernetes
- **Configuration Management:** Ansible, Terraform, Puppet, Chef
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
